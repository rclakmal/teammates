# Managing Server-Side Dependencies

TEAMMATES uses Gradle to manage dependencies to external Java libraries.

- [Adding new libraries](#adding-new-libraries)
- [Updating libraries](#updating-libraries)

## Adding new libraries

There are two factors to consider:
- Whether the library is for production or non-production code
- Whether the library is needed for compile-time or runtime only

Add the library in the appropriate section in the `build.gradle` file.

## Updating libraries

> Note the following:
- Change `./gradlew` to `gradlew.bat` in Windows.
- All the commands are assumed to be run from the root project folder, unless otherwise specified.

To update a library's version, simply change the version number declared in `build.gradle` file.

To propagate the update of dependencies to your Eclipse configuration, run the following command:

`./gradlew resetEclipseDeps`
